# Custom Password Picker

## Description

This project was made to generate strong passwords that fit into custom parameters. I created it to get familiar with using javascript to complement HTML and CSS. It has real functionality in creating passwords with specific requirements. Through this project I learned how to work with javascript to create dialogs and functions that can accomplish specific tasks.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

Click the "Generate Password" button to open a series of prompts that will allow the user to customize their password. This is done by selecting the desired length of the password, and whether or not the following characters should be included: special characters, uppercase letters, lowercase letters, and numbers. After entering all the parameters, a password matching your input will be generated.
